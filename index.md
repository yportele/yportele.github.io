Hi there!

I'm a PostDoc research assistant and lecturer at [FU Berlin](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/sonderpaedagogik/sonderpaed/Sprachentwicklung/index.html) and [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.linguistik-in-frankfurt.de/).

Within the **Psycholinguistics** working group (Prof. Dr. Markus Bader), we investigate language production and comprehension of adult (German) speakers using behavioral methods as well as eye-tracking. Among our central questions are:

* What are the factors influencing grammatical encoding during language production and how do speakers decide among several syntactic options?

	* I'm interested in potential influences due to both inherent (e.g., animacy) and derived accessibility (e.g., information structure, structural priming, and perceptual influences) as well as the way they work together from message to grammatical encoding. 
	* When and why do speakers of German, a rather free word order language, produce non-canonical strcutures, such as passive and object-before-subject (OS) sentences? Why would they prefer one option over the other? 
	
	
* How do people interpret and produce pronouns? 

	* What are semantic, syntactic, and information structural factors influencing pronoun resolution and what happens when these factors work against each other?
	* How do people deal with (potentially) ambiguous pronouns?
	* When do speakers produce or refrain from using pronouns?
